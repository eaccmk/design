## Usage

Flash alerts are used to display updates or alerts pertaining to any part of the system; this includes information regarding the user's account, the organization, the repo, and more. 

These updates are typically not user-initiated but rather alerts that require the user's attention. Similarly to toasts, flash alerts can convey a warning, error, success, or a neutral message. If additional context is needed, provide a link for the user to learn more. 

### Best practices

Use flash alerts sparingly and only when necessary. Flash alerts can disrupt the user experience and should only be used when and where relevant. 

Though flash alerts don't need to be as concise as a typical Toast message, they should still be direct and not exceed two to three sentences. Don't use headings or multiple type sizes in flash alerts, rely on our default paragraph size instead.

Don't show more than one flash alert at a time.
